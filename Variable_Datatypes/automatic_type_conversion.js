// some times js automatically treats string as number for getting the desired output
 let a = 10; 
 let b = "20";
 let c = b - a;
 let x = a + b;
 console.log(x);
 console.log(c);
//  except + all other operation will be treated as number dosent matter it is string or not
let d = a * b;
console.log(d);
let e =  b/a;
console.log(e);
